This project presents a real-time posture detection system that utilizes computer vision technologies, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to analyze and monitor human posture. The system captures video input from a camera and employs MediaPipe's pose estimation model to identify key landmarks on the human body. By processing this information with OpenCV, the system assesses posture quality and provides real-time feedback to the user. Visual cues are used to highlight posture deviations from an ideal stance, allowing users to make immediate adjustments. The project aims to promote better posture habits and raise awareness of ergonomic health by providing an accessible and intuitive tool for posture assessment and correction.  
The system can be used in various settings, from office workstations to home environments, to enhance well-being and comfort while reducing the risk of posture-related health issues. This posture detection system is designed to be versatile and can be used in various settings, from office workstations to home environments. Its user-centric approach aims to foster better posture habits, thereby reducing the risk of posture-related health issues. Additionally, the system respects user privacy by adhering to data protection regulations. By combining the capabilities of OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project offers an accessible, user-friendly, and effective tool for promoting ergonomic health, ultimately improving the well-being and comfort of users in their daily lives.
